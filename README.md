## How to run ##
**SETTING UP A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT**
1. Open terminal & navigate to project directory (`361-admin`)
2. run `python3 -m venv .`
3. run `source bin/activate`
(idk how git actually works so I'm hoping because I've installed flask it should get pushed up with it, but if not, the next couple instructions is how to get flask)
4. run (in the virtual environment) `pip install dash`
5. run (in the virtual environment) `pip install plotly`
6. run (in the virual environment) `pip install pandas` (might needs pip3 install or a pip upgrade depending on your version, follow error instructions if it doesn't work)
NOTE: you don't necessarily have to install all these dependencies in a virtual environment (this means it will be deleted once you close your virtual environment and you'll have to re-install when you open a virtual environment again)
