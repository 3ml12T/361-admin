    <h1>The InSYDE Scoop: Examining Student Comfort in Common Spaces</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">It is often difficult to understand how a student experiences their environment when you are not sitting in class next to them. This data-driven approach attempts to shine a light on student comfort through a series of data visualizations and key highlights to summarize the learning conditions of SYDE students in commonly used areas on campus.</p>
